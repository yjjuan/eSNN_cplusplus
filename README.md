# Exploring the basic properties of eSNN in C++
Evolving spiking neural network in C++

## My works:
* Explore how different hyperparameters of SNN affect performance of SNN for anomaly detection. (in c++ jupyter notebook)
  * how many hyperparameters are there in eSNN?
* Embed the SNN into running app: detection the drift of my velocity.

## Milestones:
* 20200203: I have to turn window-based ReadDirectory into Linux-based one

## Notes:
* syn w/ ~/Desktop/ubuntu_one/test01/eSNN_cplusplus
* To compile w/ Cmake,
<br> mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
