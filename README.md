# eSNN in C++
Evolving spiking neural network in C++

## My works:
* Explore how different hyperparameters of SNN affect performance of SNN for anomaly detection. (in c++ jupyter notebook)
  * how many hyperparameters are there in eSNN?
* Embed the SNN into running app

## Milestones:
* 

## Notes:
